            <p class="bodytext" id="sectext1">Much of my experience in design has come from school, but it nonetheless has taught me many things about producing visual work. I have had to doctor several images, create typography, illustrate both by hand and digitally, and write for school magazines. Most of my projects in school were received well by my teachers.</p>

            <p>I built my first website in 2015 for an extra-curricular competition, having to also organize a team to write content, take pictures and criticize the website. The next year in 2016, I built another website for the same competition, which was able to win first in the nation. I also tried experimenting with developing forums that summer, but I never achieved much functionality. Most recently in 2018 I created a website covering the emergence of AI technology, which in itself required research and presented new design challenges. </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Work/Teaching experience</h2>
        <div class="subsec">
            <p>I also have many hours in tutoring and helping elementary schoolers with computer science and basic coding concepts, through activities such as scratch day. In these events Iâ€™ve also had volunteer hours working on technical issues and using my other skills in making things run smoothly.</p>
